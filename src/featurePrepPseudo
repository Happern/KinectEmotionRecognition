in order to construct a frameFeatures object, we need to pass information from the
sensor
    - positions (x, y, z)
    - orientations
    - previous frame's frameFeatures object

the frameFeatures for frames will be kept in a buffer/a list of frameFeatures of length x
x is to be determined

for each coming frame a new frameFeatures object will be constructed and stored, older ones
will be released

what is the best structure for that? queue? (pop + append)
